              Em   C             G          D              Em
        Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
        C                G     D                Em
        Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
                 C                 G                 D              Em
        When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
                 C                G        D            G
        But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight
